# Probability Theory: Foundation for Data Science

<hr/>

An amalgamation of the course-work, the textbook, and my own research stemming from confusion along the way.
Coming from a non-stats background, currently working as a dataish scientist.
Includes some forays into R from the perspective of a python native, because all the course material is in R

<hr/> 

_my understanding of Coursera's [acceptable use policy](https://www.coursera.org/about/terms#acceptable-use-policy) is
that personal notes are fine to share, as long as it is not lifting the content. As this is an amalgamation of the
textbook the course, and my own interpretations, as far as I am aware I am not violating the copywrite of either the
textbook or the Coursera course, but if anyone knows otherwise, please flag it as an issue._
